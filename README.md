#databases
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

To get started:

Make sure your mysql is downloaded and has been started. 

mysql.server start and mysql.server stop will start and stop it.

Load the schema into your MySQL server with mysql -u root < path/to/schema.sql

Run: 

npm install
